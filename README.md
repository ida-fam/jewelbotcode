# Who am I
I am a girl who wants to learn programming and have fun with my dad at the same time :-)
I am completely new but think that it is cool to learn new things. I like to experiment a lot and
are not afraid to jump right in :-)

# VS Code Setup
Normally when Arduino is installed on windows all users will get access to the arduino enviroment. However the Jewelbots additional packages are installed per user. This means that each user on the computer must add the JewelBots boards.
1. Install the Arduino enviroment as instructed on https://jewelbots.com/pages/support. Add the JewelBots shown on the picture below.
